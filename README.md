# Sunshine-Land

>This is a self-directed solar panel prototype (sunflower). It will energize moisture sensors that will alert a water tank if you have to water the crops or not, depending on the level of moisture in the soil.

> NOTE: The code is finished\
> NOTE: The Makefile and install.sh files only works on Linux distros
